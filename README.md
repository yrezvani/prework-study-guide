# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description


My motivation for creating this web app was to learn to code as a front end developer.
I built this project to help me keep notes of what I was learning.
It solves the problem of information overload.
I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.


## Usage

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git.
If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first. 

## License

This web app uses the MIT license.
